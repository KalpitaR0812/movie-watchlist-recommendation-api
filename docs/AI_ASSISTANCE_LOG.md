PROMPTS USED – AI ASSISTANCE TRANSPARENCY
1. Purpose of This Document

This document records the prompts used with AI-based assistance tools during the development of the Movie Watchlist & Recommendation API project.
It is provided to comply with university and Infosys guidelines requiring transparency in the responsible use of AI tools for academic projects.

AI tools were used only as development assistants, similar to consulting documentation, community forums, or IDE suggestions. All system design, logic, and final implementation decisions were made by the developer.

2. AI Usage Policy

The following principles governed the use of AI throughout this project:

AI was used to assist, not replace, developer reasoning.

No code was copied blindly without understanding.

All generated suggestions were reviewed, tested, and modified where required.

The developer retains full ownership and responsibility for the project.

AI tools were primarily used to:

Clarify syntax and framework usage

Assist in documentation writing

Resolve compilation and runtime errors

Improve readability of explanations

3. Category-wise Prompts Used

The following are representative examples of prompts used during development, grouped by purpose.

3.1 Project Structuring & Architecture

“Suggest a clean layered architecture for a Go REST API”

“How should repositories, services, and handlers be organized in a Gin-based project”

“Explain clean architecture principles for backend APIs”

3.2 Database Design & Models

“How to model user–movie relationships in MongoDB”

“Best practices for MongoDB indexing in a Go application”

“How to design watchlist and rating collections for a movie application”

3.3 External API Integration (OMDb)

“How to integrate OMDb API in Golang”

“Difference between OMDb search API and movie details API”

“How to cache external API responses in MongoDB”

3.4 Authentication & Security

“How to implement JWT authentication in Gin”

“How to extract and validate Bearer tokens in Go middleware”

“Best practices for password hashing using bcrypt”

3.5 Watchlist & Rating APIs

“How to prevent duplicate entries in a watchlist”

“How to enforce one rating per user per movie”

“REST API design for user-specific resources”

3.6 Recommendation Engine Logic

“How to design a simple rule-based recommendation system”

“Explain deterministic recommendation algorithms”

“How to recommend items based on user ratings and genres”

3.7 Debugging & Error Resolution

“Why does go run main.go keep running indefinitely”

“How to fix variable redeclaration errors in Go”

“How to resolve ObjectID vs UUID mismatches in MongoDB Go driver”

4. What AI Was NOT Used For

AI tools were not used for the following activities:

Defining the project problem statement

Choosing the technology stack

Designing the recommendation algorithm logic

Making architectural or database design decisions

Writing final business logic without review

Testing, validation, or evaluation of the project

All such decisions were made entirely by the developer.

5. Statement of Ownership

This project is a complete reflection of the developer’s understanding of:

Go (Golang) backend development

RESTful API design

MongoDB data modeling

JWT-based authentication

Rule-based recommendation systems

External API integration and caching strategies

All code and documentation have been reviewed, tested, and can be clearly explained during evaluation or viva voce.
AI tools were used responsibly and transparently as development aids, not as autonomous project builders.
